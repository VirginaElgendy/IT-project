  <p class="book-details">Was there a beginning of time? Could time run backwards? Is the universe infinite or does it have boundaries? These are just some of the questions
    considered in an internationally acclaimed masterpiece which begins by reviewing the great theories of the cosmos from Newton to Einstein, 
    before delving into the secrets which still lie at the heart of space and time.</p>

  <p class="book-details">Isaac Newton laid out in mathematical terms the principles of time, force, and motion that have guided the development of modern physical science.
    Newton's principles describe acceleration, deceleration, and inertial movement; fluid dynamics; and the motions of the earth, moon, planets, and comets. A great work in itself,
    the Principia also revolutionized the methods of scientific investigation.</p>

  <p class="book-details">This book examines the huge scope of mathematical areas explored and developed by Euler, which includes number theory,
    combinatorics, geometry, complex variables and many more. The information known to Euler over 300 years ago is discussed, and many of his advances are reconstructed.
    Readers will be left in no doubt about the brilliance and pervasive influence of Euler's work.</p>
