                <p>“I’ve had a most amazing time....”<br><br>
    
                So begins the Time Traveller’s astonishing firsthand account of his journey 800,000 years beyond<br> his own era—and the story that launched H.G. Wells’s successful career and earned him his<br> reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination,<br> Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest<br> fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.  There he<br> discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only<br> symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well. <br> Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new <br>century. Thanks to Wells’s expert storytelling and provocative insight, The Time Machine will <br>continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.</p>
